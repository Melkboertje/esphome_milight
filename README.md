# 2. DCF77 for ESPhome
The DCF77 library adds the ability to read and decode the atomic time broadcasted by the DCF77 radiostation.

See the attached example "example_dcf77.yaml"

# 3. Itho for ESPhome
This is an ESPhome implementation of Itho Wifi module: https://github.com/arjenhiemstra/ithowifi.

See attached example "example_itho.yaml". This example provides also an integrated standalone PID controller to drive the Itho box, with values from the integrated humidity sensor.

# 4. I2C sniffer for ESPhome
A I2C sniffer implementation for a ESP32 module, using the code from https://github.com/ozarchie/I2C-sniffer. Will dump all the captured packets from the I2C interface to the ESPhome logging console.

# 5. ESPHome CANbus implementation to use with Remeha boilers
A CANbus implementation with use of standard ESPHome components to read CANbus messages from the service bus of newer Remeha boilers. I am using it for a Remeha Tzerra. The service bus needs to be connected with a RJ12 connector.
